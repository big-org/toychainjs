## What is ToyChain?
ToyChain is a simple (toy) implementation of a blockchain. The main purpose of the implementation is to provide a simple code foundation using which people can build their understanding of what is a blockchain.

We will build a functional system that addresses a real world problem, but the focus of the implementation is not to build a product. Rather the problem is used as a tool to ensure that we provide a complete, cohesive and pluggable blockchain solution.

**ToyChain JS** is an ES6 implementation of the [ToyChain Spec](https://github.com/big-org/toychain/wiki "ToyChain Blockchain Spec")
